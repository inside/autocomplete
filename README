Autocomplete

This javascript/Prototype.js program solves the problem of html text input
autocompletion. It minimizes web server requests by implementing a local cache
and a local refine if returned results are less than 10 (default value). Tomas
Kirda at http://www.devbridge.com/projects/autocomplete/ has inspired much of
the work here.

You need a webserver running PHP for the example to work, but any server side
scripting langage will do as long as it returns a JSON formatted response. For
example, if the typed string is "ba", the JSON is:

{"searchedString":"ba","results":["bag","bad","bam","bat","back","bake","band","bank"]}

A basic CSS is here to help you, along with the word list stopping at the letter
"e". Multiple autocompleted text input can be integrated in one page.

Autocomplete is distributed under the terms of an MIT-style license as the
original work by Tomas Kirda is.
